                        <br><br><br>
                        Over two billion dollars have been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service,
                        Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the over 300,000 projects launched on
                        Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.
                        <br><br>
                        Since getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal,
                        many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some
                        trick to finding success. In this project, I will organize and analyze a database of
                        four thousand past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.

                        <br><br><br>
                        - The above chart shows a clear bias toward theatre projects as far as the number of campaigns
                        on
                        Kickstarter. Music is the second most popular type of Kickstarter campaign followed closely by
                        technology.
                        <br><br>
                        - As far as the success rates go, music Kickstarter campaigns appear to have the highest rate of
                        success followed by theatre, and film and video. I have calculated the success rates below:
                        <br><br>
                        - Music: 540 successful campaigns/ 700 overall = 77.14% Success Rate
                        <br><br>
                        - Theatre: 839 successful campaigns/ 1393 overall = 60.23% Success Rate
                        <br><br>
                        - Film and Video: 300 successful campaigns/ 520 overall = 57.69% Success Rate
                        <br><br>
                        - Journalism is by far the laggard here. All 24 Journalism projects that were started ended up
                        being
                        canceled, thus leaving a success rate of 0%.

                        - Given the above information, the plays sub category within the theater parent category is the
                        biggest outlier as far as number of projects go.
                        <br><br>
                        - Plays account for an overwhelming majority of the campaigns in the theatre group. Out of 1393
                        theatre Kickstarter campaigns, 1066 of them are plays. Therefore, plays account for 76.53% of
                        the
                        activity in the theater parent category.

                        - The month containing the highest number of successful Kickstarter campaigns is May at 234

                        <br><br>
                        - The month containing the highest number of failed projects is July at 150 failed. This is
                        followed
                        closely by January and October which both have 149 failed projects.
                        <br><br>
                        - July and November have the most canceled projects at 43 and 37 respectively.
                        <br><br>
                        - Overall, activity seems to roughly be at it’s peak during the 2nd and 4th quarter.

                        - Projects that have a lower goal amount tend to have a higher probability of success.
                        <br><br>
                        - Inversely, projects that higher goal amount tent to have a higher probability of failure.
                        <br><br>
                        - The peak rate of success in relation to goal amount is 71% with campaigns having goals that
                        are
                        less than $1,000.

                        - The peak rate of failure in relation to goal amount is 58% with campaigns having goals that
                        are
                        above $50,000.
                        <br><br>
                        - As far as candled projects go overall, the higher the goal amount, the higher the probability

                        trending slope flattens is between goal amounts of $10,000 to $40,000. These hover roughly
                        between a
                        40% and 50% chance of success.

                        What are three conclusions we can make about Kickstarter campaigns given the provided data?
                        <br><br>
                        - Given the data one conclusion we can make about Kickstarter campaigns is that Theatre projects
                        are,
                        by far, the most prolific category of campaigns on Kickstarter.
                        <br><br>
                        - Although, it is not the most prolific project type on Kickstarter, music has the overall
                        highest
                        success rate at a circa 77.14% Success Rate.
                        <br><br>
                        - From the goal/ monies raised standpoint, if you want your project to have a greater than 50%
                        chance
                        <br><br>
                        of being fully funded, it is best to keep the goal between $0 and circa $7,500 with the highest
                        rate
                        of success being Kickstarter campaigns with goals of less than $1,000 (71% success)
                        <br><br><br><br>
                        What are some of the limitations of this dataset?
                        <br><br>
                        - It would be helpful if we had some sort of indicator as to weather or not this was a first
                        campaign
                        by the publishers or if they have released any other successful campaigns in the past.
                        <br><br>
                        - It would also be interesting to have information on what the supporters received by backing
                        projects so we could infer what influence that had on success rates. Did they receive a product
                        (if
                        so what was the monetary value), equity, producer credits etc… ?
                        <br><br><br><br>
                        What are some other possible tables/graphs that we could create?
                        <br><br>
                        - We could create a table showing the highest distribution of big money donations. (i.e. Any
                        campaign
                        that had an average donation size of $100 or more)
                        <br><br>
                        - We could also create charting around the average length of the funding period for the
                        projects. We
                        could chart this around categories and or the size of the goal.
                        <br><br>
                        - Charting could be created around the countries the Kickstarter projects were designated in.
                        <br><br>
                        - There could also be a chart created to show the success rate and categories of any project
                        that
                        was
                        a “Staff Pick”.
